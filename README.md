# COMP90051

- Content: Various technologies and conceptions in machine learning and deep learning were introduced (VC dimension, SVM, Generalization error bounds, PGM, CNN, RNN, LSTM, Transformer, Bayesian regression and classification)

- Lecturer: It is difficult to judge, but I think he is not a good lecturer as he also responsed the question on Ed with unsatisfactory sense.

- Exam: Very hard because lot of content were about Bayesian method instead of DL, but this is a subject for COMP...

- Final Score ?/100
